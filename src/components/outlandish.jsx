          <p>During my time as a UX Researcher for Outlandish I performed user research for application ideas, diagnosed the growth potential, and gave strategic guidance to the network.</p>

        <h2>the challenge</h2>
        <div className="content-background-colour">
          <p className="padding-top-40px">The project began with a stakeholder interview with my client, Harry. I was interested to know more about their goals for CoTech and the progress the network had made. We agreed upon the design challenge:</p>
          <blockquote><em>“How might we enable digital co-ops to collaborate on projects and share their human resources for hire with other co-ops?”</em></blockquote>
          <p>His idea he wanted me to do discovery phase research for was to build a ‘skills-finder’ extension to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coops.tech/">CoTech website</a> that would allow members to search and learn about each other’s businesses, people & skills to enable them to identify others to hire or go into collaborative bids with.</p>

        <h2>the approach</h2>
        <div className="content-background-colour">
          <p className="section-header padding-top-40px">secondary research</p>
          <p className="padding-top-40px">While my task was specific, the underlying goal related to broader questions of how to enable the network’s core purpose of collaboration. So I started by learning all I could about the network.</p>
          <p>I asked for an invitation into <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.coops.tech/wiki/Infrastructure_and_Communication">CoTech’s channels</a> and spent a few days researching into the history of the network, and its existing artefacts, minutes and many online discussions. I wanted a systems-level overview of what was happening to contextualise my research within and began observing potential barriers to organisations working together I could probe later on.</p>
          <div className="case-study-img-container">
            <img className="padding-top-40px" src="../../public/resources/cotech-assets/discussion-forum.png"/>
          </div>
          <p className="section-header padding-top-40px">contextual enquiry</p>
          <p className="padding-top-40px">I knew little about co-ops, and felt I also needed an inside understanding of how digital co-op’s experienced and perceived the network. I asked for a desk at Outlandish and through contacts there I was able to divide my working time between a few co-op spaces throughout research.</p>
          <p>This allowed me to sit-in on co-op ceremonies like consensus meetings, observe collaborations in progress, get invitations to networking events, and record insights into co-op culture and behaviour that informed my later personas and findings.</p>
          <p className="section-header padding-top-40px">research sprint</p>
          <p className="padding-top-40px">After the initial secondary research, I met with the development team for the web extension. We agreed I should conduct a focused research sprint in order to answer: that there was a use-case before building, how members currently handle contracting and partnerships, and the kind of information they would be looking for prior to working together.</p>
          <p>From this, we would be able to confirm what data should be stored on the website and send a survey around the network to collect it.</p>

          </div>
          <p className="section-header padding-top-40px">interviews</p>
          <p className="padding-top-40px">My <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CkcvXa6zjHNSIclHczGpIyHxLGy0GMZ5c3omO4r45jU/edit">research plan</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fLSg4qJ4O0Y5vg3wazeeTQ-AAWaAHNXxGoJ95nX6YtY/edit">discussion guide</a> was signed off quickly. I did 1:1 interviews with a member of each co-op to explore these themes as well as members’ perceptions of how the network was doing, their reasons for joining, and potential barriers to collaboration.</p>
          <p>I recruited a mixed demographic, aiming for project managers and human resources, via telephone, email, and the network’s <a target="_blank" href="https://community.coops.tech/">discussion board</a>.</p>
          <p>The majority of interviews were conducted by phone. I had noticed during
            research that the website already provided member profiles and a basic
            skills filter, so I complemented the interviews with a few remote usability tests on the website to
            measure how well it was performing this function already.</p>
          <p className="section-header padding-top-40px">synthesis</p>
          <p className="padding-top-40px">While interviewing, I met a senior researcher from <a target="_blank" href="http://weare.thesmallaxe.com/">the Small Axe</a>, Dan, who was doing his own research into the network and became a valuable source of guidance to me. We met to share and synthesise our findings on a few occasions during and after the interviews. We created an affinity diagram from these in which we grouped our observations and insights into themes.</p>

            <img className="padding-top-40px padding-bottom-80px" src="../../public/resources/cotech-assets/synthesis.JPG"/>

        <h2>the outcome</h2>
        <div className="content-background-colour">
          <p className="section-header padding-top-40px">findings</p>
          <p className="padding-top-40px">We then translated these themes into a <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s6NEu8lrcT7F0OhfSErQJImlAqA9ekJf8YoPzi20FV8/edit">report</a> I fleshed out to communicate my findings to the network.</p>
          <p>A core insight of the research was that most members would not work with other organisations prior to building personal relationships of trust. The usability tests also revealed that the website was not well used and contained minimum viable information to facilitate communication.</p>
          <p>I advised Outlandish not to build the extension as the evidence implied it would not impact the goal of increasing collaborations and these resources would be better invested in improving the network’s social capital through a variety of networking events and co-working spaces instead.</p>
          <p className="section-header padding-top-40px">outcome</p>
          <p className="padding-top-40px">This feedback was adopted and resources re-directed towards <a target="_blank" href="http://space4.tech/">Space4</a> - a co-working space for co-ops Outlandish was then establishing.</p>
          <p>I took initiative in using the report to also detail insights into the core barriers the network was facing from the perception of its members. This was well received by the organiser for the network’s AGM and he invited me to present my findings at its planning meeting.</p>
          <p>My suggestions had a positive outcome on the proposed structure for the event and its agenda. Afterwards, I was invited to attend the AGM and applied my research insights there towards aiding the formulation of the network's constitution.</p>
